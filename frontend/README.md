# Limbic front end app

This is a simple app to create and edit questions from a backend api.

# Set the baseURL in config.s file (in the root of the project)

By default points to http://localhost:3001 so make sure you run the backend API in that port as well.

# Run the app

npm start

# Tests

There are no tests in this front end app. I am very aware tests are very important, however for this demo it was quite time consuming to mock the
api requests and isolate each component. Please let me know if this is a hard requirement and I can spend some extra time writing those tests.

# mobx

I did not have experience with mobx but I've read the documentation and tried my best to implement it (this part may not be 100% correct).

# Styling & Layout

I haven't spend much time on styling. I did some basic layout and installed mui to make some components visually nicer but this UI has a LOT of room for improvement. I've did make it a bit responsive but that could also be improved.

# Dockerfile

I've provided a docker file to show we could deploy this app using ngnix (for example)

# Observations

Overall my goal was to demonstrate I am a full-stack developer and I can code both in backend or front end. If you want me to extend/improve some of the parts please let me know and I can spend some extra time on that part.
